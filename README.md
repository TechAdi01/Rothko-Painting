# Rothko Painting - CSS Box Model Project

## Overview
This project is a CSS-based **Rothko Painting**, built as part of learning the **CSS Box Model**. It applies various CSS properties, such as `border`, `padding`, `margin`, `filter`, and `box-shadow`, to create an abstract painting effect.

## Features
- **Frame and Canvas Layout**: Styled using `border` and `padding` to simulate a painting frame.
- **Blurred Color Blocks**: Using `filter: blur()` to soften edges.
- **Positioning & Transformations**: Applied `margin`, `border-radius`, and `transform: rotate()` for a natural artistic look.
- **Responsive Design**: Elements adjust properly within the container.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the painting.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and effects.
